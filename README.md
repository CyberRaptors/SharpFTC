# SharpFTC - A .NET Port of the FTC SDK and Robot Controller

SharpFTC allows teams and developers to communicate with the First Tech Challenge Robot Controller interface using C# and the .NET runtime. This repository contains the libraries needed for SharpFTC; the actual quickstart project can be found at [](not_added_yet).

Currently still under heavy testing. If something breaks, please report it as a Github issue.
